/*classes package the data and all possible operations on that data together. It's a way to view your code in a more intuitive way.
Basically, classes allow you to put your data with the code. In object-oriented programming,
a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects,
providing initial values for variables and implementations of behavior.*/
